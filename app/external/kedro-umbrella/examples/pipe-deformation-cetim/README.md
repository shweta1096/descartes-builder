# Pipe deformation use case 

To run the pipeline, use the Makefile accordingly. Different rules are provided. 

This example focuses on structural health monitoring. The goal is to predict the plastic strain of a certain structure given an observed deformation.

The pipeline proceeds as follows: 
1. Load finite element (FE) data simulate different impact strengths and obtain deformation `displ` and plastic strain `eps` values as output.
2. Reduce the deformations and plastic strains using principal component analysis (PCA): one PCA per each with Coder Box. 
3. Encode the data in PCA reduced dimensions. 
4. Train a regression model to predict the reduced plastic strain
    from the reduced deformation.
